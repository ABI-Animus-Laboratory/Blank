# Interaction-Graphs-of-Cerebrovascular-Tone
Raw Interactions Graphs of CVT regulation, for editing and community addition.

The current two figures being maintainted are
* Figure 1. neurovascular coupling and cerebral autoregulation (~arteriole level)

Please use the discussion board to share literature and mechanisms and they can be added. Hypothesized mechanisms are welcome based on experimental studies as well. 

Future work can have community consensus on "known" and "under research" mechanisms.
